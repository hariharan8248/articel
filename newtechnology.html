<h1>1.Ultracapacitors: why, how, and where is the technology</h1>

<h2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<H4>
The science and technology of ultracapacitors are reviewed for a number of electrode materials, including carbon, mixed metal oxides, and conducting polymers. More work has been done using microporous carbons than with the other materials and most of the commercially available devices use carbon electrodes and an organic electrolytes. The energy density of these devices is 3–5 Wh/kg with a power density of 300–500 W/kg for high efficiency (90–95%) charge/discharges. Projections of future developments using carbon indicate that energy densities of 10 Wh/kg or higher are likely with power densities of 1–2 kW/kg. A key problem in the fabrication of these advanced devices is the bonding of the thin electrodes to a current collector such the contact resistance is less than 0.1 Ω cm2.

Special attention is given in the paper to comparing the power density characteristics of ultracapacitors and batteries. The comparisons should be made at the same charge/discharge efficiency.</P>

<h4><p>MV- and 3D-HEVC, as well as SHVC, employ a multilayer approach where different HEVC-coded representations of video sequences, called layers, are multiplexed into one bitstream and can depend on each other. Dependencies are created by inter-layer prediction to achieve increased compression performance by exploiting similarities among different layers.

In MV- and 3D-HEVC, a layer can represent texture, depth, or other auxiliary information of a scene related to a particular camera perspective. All layers belonging to the same camera perspective are denoted as a view; whereas layers carrying the same type of information (e.g., texture or depth) are usually called components in the scope of 3D video (and should not be mistaken in the following with the color components composing a picture as defined in HEVC [7]).

<p>a typical coding structure for pictures, including four layers of two views and two components (texture and depth) for each of the shown two time instances: by design choice, all pictures associated with the same capturing or display time instance are contained in one access unit (AU) and have the same picture order count (POC). The layer of the first picture within an AU is usually denoted as the base layer. Unless the base layer is external (e.g., when using hybrid codec scalability as described in Section III-A7), it is required to conform to an HEVC single-layer profile, and hence to be the texture component of the base view. The layers of the pictures following the base layer picture in an AU are denoted as enhancement layers or non-base layers, and the views other than the base view are denoted as enhancement views or non-base views. In an AU, the order of views is required to be the same for all components. To facilitate combined coding, it is further required in 3D-HEVC that the depth component of a particular view immediately follows its texture component. An overview of dependencies between pictures in different layers and AUs is depicted in and further discussed below. Note that enhancement-layer random access point pictures are usually coded using</p>
